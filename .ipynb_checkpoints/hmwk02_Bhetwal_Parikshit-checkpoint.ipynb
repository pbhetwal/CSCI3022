Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.

    "- Any relevant data sets should be available under the **Data** module on Canvas, as well as in the zipped folder in which you obtained this assignment. To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells in a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",

Because the three of them are all scoundrels, they are all currently in Jail. In Monopoly, players roll two 6-sided dice on their turn. In their version of Monopoly, however, to get out of Jail, a player must roll *doubles* (the two dice have the same outcome) and must keep re-rolling the dice until they get doubles during their first turn in Jail. As soon as a player rolls doubles, they are let out of Jail and their turn ends. Let $D$ represent the event that a player rolls doubles.\n",

    "The amount of flips is about __100__ when it becomes apparent that the probability of doubles changes with the type of dice they have. Thus, __100 flips__ appear to be necessary before Jarrod, Courtney and Nick might become convinced of what type of dice they are playing with (fair or unfair). We can make this observation because around 100 flips the difference between the probability of doubles with fair dice versus unfair dice becomes apparent on the figure that I have displayed. "

When they leave the Engineering Center (E) from their Data Science class, they like to go to 5 other places on campus: the Gym ($G~$) to exercise, the Library ($L~$) to learn, the Hill ($H~$) to grab a sandwich, Weathertech Cafe ($W~$) for a pizza, and the mountains ($M~$) to frolic with their marmot friends.\n",

    "- Third, I declared a counter called counter that keeps track of when we end up at W(Weathertech Cafe) or H(The Hill) in either one move or two moves, which is what we want.\n",

    "    - Another way to get to W or H is from L, so we check to see if in one move we get to L \n",
    "        - If we do end up at L in one move, I have a variable called twoMovesL that randomizes possible destinations from L \n",
    "        - If we either land on H or W from this twoMovesL variable, we increment the counter since this would be the ways to either get to H or W from L in two moves \n",

    "In this problem you will write some code to simulate the game of **Miniopoly** (a very rough approximation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)\">Monopoly</a>).  The game consists of a round board with 40 \"squares\" numbered from $0$ to $39$, where squares $0$ and would-be $40$ are [coincident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincident) and called **GO**.  A player starts on **GO** with \\$200 in their pocket.  On each turn the player rolls a pair of dice and then moves a number of spaces equal to the sum of the dice.  Landing on different squares have different results: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 2, 7, 17, 22, 33, and 36 cause you to draw a card.  The cards tell you to collect \\$50 or \\$100, or pay the bank \\$25 or \\$100.  There is always an equal probability associated with each of these possible cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Square 20 is **Free Parking**. If a player lands on Square 20, then they are awarded a Free Parking Bonus of \\$500. This should be a generic input variable to your `miniopoly_turn` function called `bonus`, so you can modify it later. But, the default value for `bonus` should be \\$500.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Square 30 is **Go To Jail**. (So if a player has landed on Square 30, then you know they have been to jail.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a player starts a turn from **Jail** she rolls two dice: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the player rolls doubles (i.e. the dice have equal values), then the player moves from Square 10 a number of squares equal to the sum of the dice\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If the player rolls anything other than doubles, then she pays the bank \\$20 and remains in **Jail** \n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "- If the player lands on any other square not mentioned above, she pays the bank an amount equal to the square's number (e.g. if she lands on Square 29 she pays the bank \\$29). \n",

    "<p> </p>\n",

    "If at any point the player has \\$0 or less they go bankrupt and the game ends.\n",

Note that if a player goes bankrupt during the game you should return their cash as 0 instead of a negative value.\n",

    "The Free Parking rule affects the Miniopoly games by making it less likely for one to go bankrupt than if they did not have the rule. We can make this conclusion because from the results we can see that there is about a 4-5% difference of going bankrupt when one does not have a bonus. \n",
